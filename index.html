            Developer looking for work !
        </h3>

        <img class="self-image fill-grey" src="images/pilt.jpg">

        <p class="introduction">
        I have 8 years of experience working as a developer. I have worked as freelancer and full time employee for startups or small businesses.
        My portfolio includes work from fully built SaaS platforms to landing pages done with HTML and CSS. 
        </br>
        I can build applications that work on multiple devices, like desktop, phones, tablets and are still fully responsive and easy to use. 
        </br>
        I am experienced working on front-end and backend, working with Linux servers and databases is no problem.
        </br>
        </br>
        Writing software is something that I enjoy doing, and hopefully can enjoy doing it for living, many years to come.
        </br>
        On my free time I enjoy camping, paddleboarding and working in the garden with plants.
        </br>
        </br>
        Contact me, if you would like to hire me for building software or need consultancy on already built project.
